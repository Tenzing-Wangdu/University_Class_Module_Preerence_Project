# University_Class_Module_Preference_Project

Welcome to the University Class Module Preference project! This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on understanding student preferences for class modules at a university. The project utilizes various tools and technologies such as Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Qualtrics to gather and analyze data.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to gather insights into students' module preferences and determine their inclination towards hybrid classes. The project aims to understand the factors that influence students' module choices and identify the most preferred class formats.

# Tools and Technologies Used

To accomplish the objectives of this project, the following tools and technologies were employed:

Python: Python programming language was used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Python provides a wide range of libraries and packages, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, that facilitate efficient data processing and analysis.
Jupyter Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks were used as an interactive coding environment to develop and present the analysis. Notebooks provide a convenient platform for combining code, visualizations, and explanations.
Google Colab: Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, was utilized for collaborative coding and analysis. It allows multiple users to work on the same notebook simultaneously and provides access to various libraries and resources.
Excel: Excel was utilized for data preprocessing, data cleaning, and organizing the survey results. Excel's features and functions were leveraged to perform data manipulation and generate summary statistics.
Microsoft PowerPoint: Microsoft PowerPoint was used to create visually appealing and informative presentations to convey the findings and insights of the project.
Qualtrics: Qualtrics, an online survey platform, was used to design and conduct the survey to gather data on student preferences. Qualtrics offers a user-friendly interface for creating customized surveys and collecting responses.
Project Workflow

The project workflow can be summarized as follows:

Survey Design: A survey was created using Qualtrics to collect data on students' module preferences. The survey was designed to capture information about class formats, preferences, and reasons for selecting specific modules.
Data Collection: The survey was distributed among the target student population to gather responses. The data collected from the survey formed the basis for further analysis.
Data Preprocessing: The collected survey data was preprocessed using Excel. This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and organizing it into a suitable format for analysis.
Data Analysis: Python and Jupyter Notebooks were used to perform exploratory data analysis, visualize the survey results, and extract meaningful insights. Various statistical techniques and visualization tools were employed to identify patterns and trends in the data.
Presentation: The findings and insights obtained from the analysis were summarized and presented using Microsoft PowerPoint. The presentation highlighted the key takeaways, module preferences, and the preference for hybrid classes.
